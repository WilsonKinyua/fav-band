            <h2>Who are H_ART THE BAND?</h1>
                <p>
                    At the end of 2012, <em>MORDECAI KIMEU</em> auditioned alongside <em>KENNETH MUYA</em> and
                    <em>WACHIRA GATAMA</em> to establish H Art the Band. Mordecai auditioned Kenchez and Wachira for a
                    performance on cancer awareness at the <strong>Kenya National Theatre</strong> in late 2012, and the
                    three met in the
                    corridors of their performing careers. During rehearsals, the three learned that they shared a love
                    of music, spoken word/poetry, comedy, dancing, fashion, and life in general. H ART the BAND was
                    founded not long after, on the 22nd of February 2013, when the three performed together for the
                    first time at that Ethiopian eatery.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With both Mordecai and Wachira having been crowned <q>Slam Africa Kings</q>, H_ART’s music is
                    heavily
                    inspired by spoken word poetry. Self taught guitarist Kenchez compliments the rhymes with smooth,
                    danceable tunes and some undeniable Luhya swag. Everywhere H_ART performs, they leave a lasting
                    impression.

            <h2>Why the H_ART THE BAND?</h1>
                <p>
                    As they describe themselves in the Facebook Page
                </p>
                <p class="fb_quote">
                    <q>
                        Basically we do art from the heart..we have created a langauge best understood not by the
                        mind…but by the heart. Imagine acoustics, smooth vocals,with a touch of poetry,spoken word,
                        freestyle rap,drama, dance and fashion all blended into one thick pastry of art.

            For the following reasons, I would always choose them over any other band:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Musical Style</strong> - Their musical style has been described as abstract, African-pop,
                    urban-colored vintage, uniquely hilarious, HAIR band..."to mention a few phrases used to describe
                    this diverse group of artists.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Their Inspiration</strong> - H ART's music is highly influenced by everyday life. With
                    Mordecai and Wachira both being "Slam Africa Kings," Kenchez, a self-taught guitarist, complements
                    their rhymes with smooth, danceable tunes, while Mordecai wows their jams with his heavenly vocals
                    and lyrics at seemingly calculated moments, this fusion creates a fresh new style they like to call
                    "AFROPOETRY."</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Fusion of Poetry and Music</strong> - Various Kenyan Poets that have explored other kinds of
                    poetry performance albeit not with the same success as H art the Band are Ngwatilo in her 2nd album
                    Intoducing Ngwatilo and Kevin Man Njoro who also goes by the stage name Nemesis ( he is also a Hip
                    Hop artist) ( he is also a Hip Hop artist)</li>
            </ul>
