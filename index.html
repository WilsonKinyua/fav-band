                <strong>Bien-Aimé Baraza, Willis Chimano,</strong> and <strong>Savara Mudigi</strong> created the
                Kenyan afro-pop band <em>Sauti Sol</em> in
                Nairobi, Kenya in 2005. <strong>Polycarp Otieno</strong>, a guitarist, joined the group before they
                changed their
                name to Sauti Sol.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mwanzo, Sauti Sol's debut studio album, was released on November 1, 2008, to critical acclaim. Sol
                Filosofia, their second studio album, was released on February 25, 2011, and received numerous
                honors and nominations. The band collaborated with South African rapper and song producer Spoek
                Mathambo to create a self-titled extended play on June 18, 2012.
            </p>
            <p>
                The band has completed several successful tours in Africa and Europe, topped Kenyan charts, and
                gained international attention with shows in Europe and the United States, as well as television
                appearances and numerous accolades and nominations, including a concert performance in Kenya in 2011
                with Ladysmith Black Mambazo, a South African a cappella group.

        <h2 class="why_heading">Why the Sauti Sol?</h2>
        <p>
            For the following reasons, I would always choose them over any other band:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Musical Style</strong> - Their musical style has been described as abstract, African-pop,
                urban-colored vintage, uniquely hilarious.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Their Inspiration</strong> - Sauti Sol's music is highly influenced by everyday life. </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fusion of Poetry and Music</strong> - Various Kenyan Poets that have explored other kinds of
                poetry performance not with the same success as Sauti Sol.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
