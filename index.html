                    <strong>Bien-Aim√© Baraza, Willis Chimano,</strong> and <strong>Savara Mudigi</strong> created the

                    Nairobi, Kenya in 2005. <strong>Polycarp Otieno</strong>, a guitarist, joined the group before they
                    changed their
                    name to Sauti Sol.
